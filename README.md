# Personal-Project-in-Data-Analysis-Course

## Project Overview

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python and creating a dashboard in Tableau. The EDA presents an examination of the evolving e-commerce landscape in Pakistan, focusing on consumer behavior, transaction patterns, and market trends from March 2016 to August 2018. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we aim to analyze and interpret various aspects of e-commerce transactions, including purchasing trends, payment preferences, and category performance. 

The primary objective of the dashboard in Tableau is to analyze product categories, aiming to identify purchasing trends across different months of the year, assess which category presents a favorable investment opportunity, and determine suitable payment methods for different products based on their price range.
